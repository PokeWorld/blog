So, some things have happened so far this week. Let's go over them.

### PokeWorld Hits 100 Members

Yep, you read that right. We finally hit 100 members. We, in fact, hit it 6 times before finally maintaining over 100 members on the discord, and then finally losing the ability to see offline members. We would like to thank all PokeWorld members for making this possible, and especially thanking the staff: Chara, jtsshieh, TheEdge, Alee, usChara, and Sylveon.

### Revolution Project Restarted

An old Pallet project, Revolution, was restarted. You can find it on the GitHub page linked in the footer below. Since we already did some much work for Milestone 1, I decided the best decision would be to not kill the project.

### PokeBot Hits 100 Servers

As well as PokeWorld hitting 100 members, PokeBot is now on 100 servers. We would like to thank these servers for having us:

### Universe Gets a New Domain

Due to the website no longer being for PokeWorld only, I (TheEdge) bought a new domain for the group. You will visit us by now using *universedevgroup.net*, rather than *digitalregion.ml*.
